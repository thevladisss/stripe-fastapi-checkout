# stripe-fastapi-checkout

A simple e-commerce checkout prototype built with FastAPI (Python) and React. Users can browse a product catalog, select items, and complete purchases via Stripe's hosted Checkout page. The backend creates dynamic checkout sessions and handles payment processing, while the frontend provides a modern UI for product selection and order confirmation.
